Our project takes data from harmful air particles that is from transport, the air quality index.Our model predicts the AQI based on the number of cars in the particular state. Our aim is to make the environment more lively in terms of human health

Traffic is the most important problem in India which is causing illness. Many people have reported acute respiratory problem. We need to manipulate traffic in that area so as to keep up the standards of AQI(Air Quality Index).
